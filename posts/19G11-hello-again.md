Hello again Interne»õ!

I just published this blog on the website https://trinkets.tech/ !

It is powered by the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) site generator.

The posts are still available in the https://github.com/ShinyTrinkets/docs/ repository and you can view the history of all changes.

I exploded the big "captain-log.md" file into separate files for each post.<br/>
I intend to delete the captain-log after some time.

For the URL of the articles, for the months, I'm using letters instead of numbers, like so:<br/>
A=january, B=february, ... K=november, L=december.<br/>
This way the YYYY-MM-DD long format can be compressed to only 5 characters, eg: 19G11 == 2019-07-11.


I still have a lot of work to do for this website:

* use better fonts
* add a logo (spoiler alert: my brother is working on that üòÅ)
* allow people to comment
* have some sort of basic traffic analytics (something not Google)
* see what other people are doing with Hugo and improve the layout
