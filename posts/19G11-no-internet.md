Hello, lack of internet...

For some reason, I don't have Internet today, so I can't do much...

However, it's a blessing, because I realize just how much I depend on it.

Things that I have offline, so I was prepared:

* a ton of notes, TODOs, ideas, links to useful resources, saved as Markdown files
* some articles downloaded with [âž¹ Clean-mark](https://github.com/croqaz/clean-mark)
* all the posts for this website and all the history of the changes

Things what I wish I had (more of):

* offline documentation for Go-lang, Python and Node.js
* more technical articles to find inspiration and answers
* the CSS, JS and fonts for this website

I think everyone should consider, at least once in a while, what they would do if they didn't have access to the internet for a few days.<br/>
And take action, to be prepared for that.
