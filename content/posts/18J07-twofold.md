Not too much progress with [TwoFold (2âœ‚ï¸Žf)](https://github.com/ShinyTrinkets/twofold.js) these days...

I discovered [Nearley.js](https://nearley.js.org/) and I think it might solve my parsing dilemma.

Unfortunately, I have to work on some personal things these weeks, so I don't think I'll make any progress this month ðŸ˜¢
