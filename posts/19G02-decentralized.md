I believe decentralized applications are very important and I'm not the only one to think that.<br/>
I've been watching the P2P and crypto space for years. For me personally, [decentralization technologies](https://github.com/croqaz/awesome-decentralized) =equal= freedom. Freedom to choose where you send your data and where you store it. Because if there are no "cloud" servers, you are in control.

I want to use P2P network protocols for the Trinkets suite because there won't be any servers.<br/>
This is not the most natural, or the most comfortable thing to do, but it's the only way that aligns with my vision.<br/>
This will be needed to allow the [Spinal ðŸŒ€](https://github.com/ShinyTrinkets/spinal) applications talk to each other, sync up, share logs, share data, or collaborate to finish tasks.

Github has a specific topic about it: [Github decentralization topic](https://github.com/topics/decentralization).

I started to watch some podcasts about decentralized technologies:

* IRL podcast [S4 Ep6: Decentralize It](https://irlpodcast.org/season4/episode6/)
* Changelog podcast [Ep 346: Off the grid social networking with Manyverse](https://changelog.com/podcast/346)
* Changelog podcast [Ep 42: Decentralizing the web with Beaker](https://changelog.com/jsparty/42)

I'm sure there are many others and I'll find them if I have time.
